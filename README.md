# Gradient_Descent_in_Linear_Regression

In linear regression, the model targets to get the best-fit regression line to predict the value of y based on the given input value (x). While training the model, the model calculates the cost function which measures the Root Mean Squared error between the predicted value (pred) and true value (y). The model targets to minimize the cost function.
